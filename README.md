# Rezkeeper
SEI 5/9 Project 4 Capstone: Rezkeeper  </br>
Rezkeeper is a personal keeper app, in which users can schedule restaurant visits, as in enter in the name, image, address, food type (ex: desserts), the day the want to go, and the time. It's a way to keep track of all the great (or not so great) restaurants one has visited. As someone who lives in NYC, such a big place with so many great options for food, it's nice to remember all the places I've been to and all the food I liked at certain places.

# User Story
- As a user, we want to be able to create an account for the application and be able to log in and logout.
- Once the user is logged in, the user should be able to schedule restaurant visits, as in enter in the name, image, address, food type (ex: desserts), the day the want to go, and the time. They can also schedule the day as a passed date because maybe they want a place to hold a great restaurant they went to.
- Once a restaurant date is passed the current date, the restaurant gets placed in the history page.
- Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete their restaurants, both scheduled and passed.
- Once as restaurant gets placed in to the history page, the user can see options to add their orders, give it a rating, and write a review. (They can also delete orders, rating, and review).
- The User should only be able to write one rating and review per restaurant, meaning that ince there is a rating or review present, those forms will disappear.
